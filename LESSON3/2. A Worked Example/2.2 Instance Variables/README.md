## Instance Variables

Let’s start to fill out our instance variables. Instance variables in Java are going to look a lot like those global variables you were told to never use in APSC 160. They will be within the curly braces of the object, but outside of any method. Let’s add our variables to this.
```java
public class MyPetDog{
    public String name;
    public String breed;
    public int age;
}
```
Nothing too crazy, except for that mysterious `public` keyword. We will talk about that at the end of this example, but for now, let’s leave it as is. We know, yet another “just trust us and write this here we will explain it later.” Sadly there are a lot of catch 22s in Java.
