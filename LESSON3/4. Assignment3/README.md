# Assignment:
Create a class for the overarching project called NAME that has private instance variables NAMES where RESTRICTION, each with their own getters and setters, a default constructor with defaults TBD and another constructor that lets the user set the variables as they please (you can use your setters in the constructor, by the way!). Additionally, add a public method that does TBD.
