For some reason, private instance variables of a superclass can not be accessed by methods in the subclass. This can be fixed the same way we have previously, with public getter and setter methods, or you can use the keyword `protected`. Essentially, this keyword still means other classes in different packages can not access a certain method or variable, but subclasses can. [There is some extra subtle parts, this article covers it well](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/protected-keyword-in-java-with-examples/)
