# THE THREE BIG TOOLS

The 3 most useful tools in InteliJ are the Debugger, the git tools, and the refactoring tools.

Watch this lovely video to get an overview of all 3 (TODO ADD LINK ONCE UPLOADED)

## Some more info on debugging

The video above only scratched the surface of the debugger in IntelliJ. This should be enough info for this course and CPEN 221, but if you want to learn more [check out the IntelliJ documentation on this feature!](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/debugging-code.html) in Particular, the section on asynchronous code will become very useful near then end of CPEN 221!

## Git

Github also has useful tools in browsers. Particularly useful is you can browse the commit history of any repository. This is extremely useful for finding code you thought you deleted, or restoring the project if you corroupt it by mistake (rare, but it can happen, especially if your computer crashes during a commit). For more info, explore the depths of the github repositroy you hopefully made during this lesson.
