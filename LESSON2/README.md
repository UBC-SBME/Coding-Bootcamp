# WELCOME TO LESSON 2!

This lesson is where we will set up the tools required both for this course and CPEN 221. Lets get right into it!

## INSTALLING JAVA

This step might be completed for some of you already (especially if you have installed Minecraft) but we first need to instal Java onto our systems. CPEN 221 requires us to instal the Java Development Kit (JDK) version 16 or later. Luckily, it is pretty easy to do.

[Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html#JDK14)

Click on the link above, then click JDK Download (below the Oracle JDK header). At the top of the page you can download JDK 16, but if you scroll down you can download JDK 11. We recommend getting the latest version of JDK.
After clicking that link you will be taken to a page that lists the various JDK 16 versions for each different operating system. Download the installer for your specific operating system. For example, if I am on Windows I would want to download the Windows x64 Installer. If I am on mac I would want the macOS Installer. Once that is downloaded, run it. The installer should walk you through the rest.

## INSTALLING GIT AND GIT BASH (Windows only)

This is a windows only step. If you are on MacOS git should be installed already or you may need to install XCode's Command Line Tools. If you are on Linux then use the package installer.

Windows users: Just click on the windows link in page from the link above and it should start a download. Run the file it downloads.
Windows users also have to download git for windows, found [here!](https://gitforwindows.org/)
