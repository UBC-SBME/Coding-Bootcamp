## INSTALLING JAVA

We need Java in order to compile and write our code for this course, so let's install it!

This step might be completed for some of you already (especially if you have installed Minecraft) but we first need to install Java onto our systems. CPEN 221 requires us to install the Java Development Kit (JDK) version 16 or later. Luckily, it is pretty easy to do.

[Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html#JDK14)

Click on the link above, then click JDK Download (below the Oracle JDK header). At the top of the page, you can download JDK 16, but if you scroll down you can download JDK 11. We recommend getting the latest version of JDK.
After clicking that link you will be taken to a page that lists the various JDK 16 versions for each different operating system. Download the installer for your specific operating system. For example, if you are on Windows you would want to download the Windows x64 Installer. If you are on mac I would want the macOS Installer. Once that is downloaded, run it. The installer should walk you through the rest.

## INSTALLING GIT AND GIT BASH

Git is a source-code management tool. Basically, this will allow you to pull code we make for you, or upload code you make onto a site like GitHub to not only keep it backed up but to also check differences between versions of code. It is incredibly useful.

If you are on MacOS git should be installed already or you may need to install XCode's Command Line Tools. If you are on Linux then use the package installer.

Windows users: Just click on the windows link on the page from the link above and it should start a download. Run the file it downloads.
Windows users also have to download git for windows, found [here!](https://gitforwindows.org/)

## CREATE A GitHub account

This is just useful so you can upload your code online. Also, this is a great piece of tech for getting coding-based jobs, and you can give a potential employer a link to your GitHub and they can look at the type of projects you have completed!

## INSTALLING GRADLE

Gradle is a build tool. It is used to automate some steps needed during compilation. For example, it will download external libraries that might be needed in some projects for you automatically!

[To install Gradle, click on this link, and follow the steps under the Installing manually section!](https://gradle.org/install/)

## INSTALLING INTELIJ IDEA

IntelliJ IDEA is a fantastic Java development tool and is what we will use for the creation of programs both in this course and in CPEN 221. It has fantastic built-in tools for debugging, dealing with git, and code writing. 

There are two options.

1. Goto [this link](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), click the big blue download button and download the community version of IntelliJ
2. Goto [this link](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), click the big blue download button, and download the ultimate version of IntelliJ, and then go to [this link](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students) and apply for a student license.

Option 1 is certainly quicker, but option 2 will give you access to all of Jet Brains' various IDEs. In particular, they have a fantastic python IDE that has some key features locked behind a paywall that option 2 will alleviate. Other than that, the download page for IntelliJ lists what extra features the ultimate version has. See if they are worthwhile, and make your decision based on that. If you want to try website development on your own time, the ultimate addition does have some fantastic features for that!

## TROUBLESHOOTING

Sometimes the installation process can be the worst part of a coding course. If you have any problems, please attend an office hour or post on Piazza, and a member of the teaching team will try their best to assist!
