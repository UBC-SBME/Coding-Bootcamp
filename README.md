# Welcome to the BMEG Coding Bootcamp!

Hello Everyone, my name is Paul Juralowicz, and I will be the host of this course. I am currently a PhD. student in SBME, but I was an undergrad in SBME up until I graduated in 2022. I also created this course with Umar Ali a few years ago, and I am very excited to teach it again.

My goal for this course is to give you some lessons on programming as BMEG students tend to struggle with it, both in 2nd year and throughout their degree. In particular, students have difficulty with CPEN 221, which is quite a time consuming and difficult programming course. Back in my undergrad, when I heard about CPEN 221's difficulty, I bought a book about Java (Head First Java), read the first few chapters, and tried to program the first "assignment" (a very basic battleship clone if I remember correctly). This prepared me well for the start of CPEN 221, though I still had a lot to learn.

This course tries to be that book, but in a more accessible (and free) format. We have made this in such a way that you should have a development enviroment open at all times (we provide insturctions on how to download this) and you should try the code snippets as you complete the lesson, ideally modifying them to see how they change. The best way to learn how to program is to do it, of course!

I will always be available to help students, both on Piazza and through office hours, which you can schedule through Canvas. Please use canvas messages to message me. I know my student email is listed but it is only because I am not allowed to list my gmail.

Anyhow, here is the original blurb I wrote in 2021. I hope you enjoy my course and learn at least a little.

So, you’ve just finished APSC 160, and are about to start your coding journey with a course like CPEN 221. You learned some foundational coding practices in APSC 160, but have heard the horror stories about CPEN, some whispers about a weird language called Java, some cursed rune called a programming proficiency test, and an eldritch sorcerer called Sathish. Luckily, instead of just learning the language as you go, you’ve decided to complete the BMEG Coding Bootcamp! Throughout the following lessons, you should gain a knowledge of programming practices and some practice in Java that (hopefully) will make the transition to CPEN 221 an actual transition instead of a headfirst impact that leads to a compressive fracture of the cervical spine.
