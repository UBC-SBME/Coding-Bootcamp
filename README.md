# Weclome to the BMEG Coding Bootcamp!

So, you’ve just finished APSC 160, and are about to start your coding journey with a course like CPEN 221. You learnt some foundational coding practices in APSC 160, but have heard the horror stories about CPEN, some whispers about a weird language called Java, some cursed rune called a programming proficiency test, and an eldritch sorcerer called Satish. Luckily, instead of just learning the language as you go, you’ve decided to complete the BMEG Coding Bootcamp! Throughout the following lessons, you should gain a knowledge of programming practices and some practice in Java that (hopefully) will make the transition to CPEN 221 an actual transition instead of a headfirst impact that leads to a compressive fracture of the cervical spine.

The folders above contain the information for each lesson. Check them out!
