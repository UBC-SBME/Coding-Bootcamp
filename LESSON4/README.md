# Welcome to Lesson 4

This lesson will cover the Java documentation, native Java objects, and some motivating examples.

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

* Read and understand java documentation in order to implement functionality in your program
* Know how to create and use the following datatypes:
  * ArrayList
  * Stack
  * Queues
  * HashSet
  * Hashmap
* Be able to use Java objects/data types effectively
* Understand when to use Java objects/data types
* Know the differences between various Java data types
* Know when to use certain Java objects

**Don't reinvent the wheel**. The goal of Java's native objects are to help you build your project reliably and without having to worry about the small details. Java has a lot of very useful native objects that can immensely aid in your project; use this to your advantage!
