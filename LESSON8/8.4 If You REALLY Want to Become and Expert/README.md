# If You REALLY Want to Become and Expert

If you really want to jump down the rabit hole and learn MATLAB from the inside out, we recomend you take the MATLAB Onramp. This is a roughly 2 hour course from MathWorks that covers almost everything you need to know about MATLAB.

[You can find the link for it right here!](https://www.mathworks.com/learn/tutorials/matlab-onramp.html)

Additional courses for other features of MATLAB can be found [here](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/).

The particularly useful on ramps for MATLAB are the Signal Processing Onramp (useful for BMEG 321!) and the Simulink Onramp (useful if you plan to go into Signals and Systems!)
